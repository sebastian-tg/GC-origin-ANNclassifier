# GC-origin-MLclassifier
Implementation of an artificial neural network to predict the origin of GCs in external galaxies from their observed properties

This repository contains the ANN model and an example Juoyter notebook showing how to use it to predict the origin labels (in-situ or accreted)of globular clusters
based on their observed properties. The ANN classifier is described and tested on simulated and real data for the Milky Way in [ref].
